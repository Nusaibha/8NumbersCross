Description: 8NumbersCross is a C++ program that solves a constraint-based number placement puzzle involving eight unique numbers arranged in a cross-shaped pattern. The objective is to place the numbers 1 through 8 in specific positions such that no number is repeated and no adjacent positions (defined by a custom adjacency list) contain consecutive integers. This ensures a valid configuration that meets both uniqueness and adjacency constraints. The program uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore all possible valid arrangements. It includes a verification function (ok()) that checks for duplicate numbers and invalid adjacent pairings. When a valid solution is found, the program prints the arrangement in a visual format that reflects the cross shape. This project is well-suited for those interested in learning about constraint satisfaction problems, backtracking, and recursive algorithms in C++. It demonstrates how logic and structure can be applied to generate valid solutions in a finite and structured search space.
